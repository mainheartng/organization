# Description 
After discussing with the team we agreed to kick off the project and deploy an API, a Web app, an Android App, and an iOS APP. I've listed the languages for each use-case below.

* Backend - OOP Js 
  * Framework express js - https://expressjs.com/
* Mobile Android - Core java/kotlin
* Mobile iOS - Swift
* Landing - React, and Redux
* Database - Postgres
* Server - Linux DO
* Tests - Jest

## Dependencies
### API
For a functional API built with javascript we suggest using some other dependencies which are listed below
* Expressjs - https://expressjs.com: A framework for building API on Nodejs, checkout a [youtube crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE)
* sequlize - https://sequelize.org/: For implementing SQL queries
* pg - https://node-postgres.com/: PostGres drive for connecting
* Postgres - https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgres: a PostgreSQL dependency
* Redis - https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis: Redis is an open source, in-memory data store used by millions of developers as a database, cache, streaming engine, and message broker. [Learn more](https://redis.io/)

other dependencies are `body-parser`, `cors`, `morgan`, and `helmet`.
